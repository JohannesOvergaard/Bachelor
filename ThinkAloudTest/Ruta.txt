- asked about logo for Join Denmark

- liked the step by step (join dk category)

- easy topics to choose from
- clear and intuitive (easy to understand what you can do (click))

- Nicer frontend - like the simplicity, not the color choice, not pictures but icons instead to have a cleaner look. 

- links to external websites gives credibility

- skeptical of new apps so would still look outside if it has few downloads(but external links can avoid that)'

- likes simplicity, and that it is easy to understand what you can do

- prefers to be redirected in drop down

- public sector, like that they are gathered one place

- join dk make it different (the button maybe) not visuall similar as this is a different thing (A core thing when you come here) looks like nice to know but it is very useful
