He thinks that we need something like this , not all content is covered (We know)

He would use when he come to denmark and even now becuause he still not understand some aspects of taxes

- What features did you like?

Like Join Denmark , would like more steps

Like the overview with the tiles on the frontpage

The design (Thought tiles would be smaller if there was more)

On join denmark it would be nice to have and explanation of each steps

- When would you be most likely to use this app? (follow up can we improve this)

As a newcomer in Denmark

But if we add more steps, about everydaylife, he would still use it as a guide today

- What did you think was missing?

The explanations of each steps in Join Denmark

### Personalization
- What did you think of the login feature? 

Did not saw the login logo because it was small 

And because he has access to everything

- What did you think about the personalization?
	- Settings
	
	If we have much more categories it would make sense , but instead he would like favorite button
	
	- joinDk
	
	Understands that it is a checklist
	
	Like it espeacally in the begining, but today he would not use the Join Denmark category.

### Search
- What did you think of the search feature?

When he clicked it he would like to see favorite asked questions

### Navigation
- How did you find the navigation? (did it make sense, was it intuitive)

Quite intuitive how to use the app.

Navigation was simple

The pictures on the tiles made it hard to read the name of the category.

## Notes to self:
- Do they read on the login site
- Do they look confused about the settings
