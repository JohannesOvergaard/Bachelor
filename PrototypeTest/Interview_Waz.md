goes to accomodation and reads more, uses search

The pictures made the app more friendly

Join denmark seems funny

- What did you not like? (follow up how can we improve)

Hard to read the titles on tiles, search confusing that he gets every topic in accommodation (gets the whole category)

Join Denmark, ignoring that he needs to click see more to gets documents

Drop down / step tiles only opens when clicking on the text?

- When would you be most likely to use this app? (follow up can we improve this)

When moving to Denmark, if someone told him about the app, would be more confident using this app rather than an relying an answer on Facebook, could use the public sector category the rest of his life.. like you never understand taxes.

- What did you think was missing?

Something about weather and nature in Denmark

A new to Denmark category

A setting saying "I am new to Denmark"

Did not understood why he should login because he could see everything

Din't think he would login if he was already in the application

- What did you think about the personalization?
	- Settings
	- joinDk
	  - Does not like the join Denmark category. Would rather like checkboxes to mark the checkboxes.

### Search
- What did you think of the search feature?

Gave him the impression that it was broken 

Unclear that the search function is for the whole app. He understand it as a filter function on the page he is at. 

The search function should also search for tiles (and other words that are displayes on the screen)

### Navigation
- How did you find the navigation? (did it make sense, was it intuitive)

Is fine , ingnoring that search function zoom

## Notes to self:
