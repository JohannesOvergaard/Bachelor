### Test:

Text unclear on pictures, easy to se things, like organisation of menues in category-age 

zoom on search

After reading the why he can login to the application he still don't understand the purpose of loggin in.

 

Email login: The password has to be longer and the user does not get that message

Settingspage: Does not understand what happens.

	- why did you not login at start

## Questions
### Overall
- What is your overall impression?

goes to accomodation and reads more, uses search

The pictures made the app more friendly

- What features did you like?

Join denmark seems funny

- What did you not like? (follow up how can we improve)

Hard to read the titles on tiles, search confusing that he gets every topic in accommodation (gets the whole category)

Join Denmark,  ignoring that he needs to click see more to gets documents

Drop down / step tiles only opens when clicking on the text?

- When would you be most likely to use this app? (follow up can we improve this)

When moving to Denmark, if someone told him about the app, would be more confident using this app rather than an relying an answer on Facebook, could use the public sector category the rest of his life.. like you never understand taxes.

- What did you think was missing?

Something about weather and nature in Denmark

A new to Denmark category

A setting saying "I am new to Denmark"

### Personalization
- What did you think of the login feature? 

Did not understood why he should login because he could see everything

Din't think he would login if he was already in the application

- What did you think about the personalization?
	- Settings
	- joinDk
	  - Does not like the join Denmark category. Would rather like checkboxes to mark the checkboxes.

### Search
- What did you think of the search feature?

Gave him the impression that it was broken 

Unclear that the search function is for the whole app. He understand it as a filter function on the page he is at. 

The search function should also search for tiles (and other words that are displayes on the screen)

### Navigation
- How did you find the navigation? (did it make sense, was it intuitive)

Is fine , ingnoring that search function zoom

Close icon on search bar could be bigger

## Notes to self:
- Do they read on the login site
- Do they look confused about the settings



## Notes when listen trough it again

### Positive

Like the idea of the application
Like categorypage , pictures make it friendly
Like the navigation, easy to come around in the app, like the backarrow and the homebutten

### Negative

hard to read text on tiles
ignoring that he need to click to se list of documents in join Denmark, when there is only one extra line
Search didn't seems to work , ignoring that the screen zooms when clicking on search , he thought it was a filter function, which filters the content on the screen
After reading the why he can login to the application he still don't understand the purpose of loggin in.
Did not get a message that the password has to be longer than 6 characters when creating an account with email
Does not understand the text i.e. EU, what happens when he clicks the checkboxes on the settingspage
Does not understands the Join Denmark page, did not realised that it was a checklist
did not find the purpose of loggin in, because he could already see everything
The loggin function would only make sence, if the application grew a low.

### Suggestions

Suggested that we could improve our phrasing of some categories. e.g change the "step by step" of the Join Denmark to "Follow your progress", to give the user the impression that it is their checklist
Suggested text over the settings to explain them
Suggested a setting saying "i Am new in denmark"
Suggested something about wheather and nature in Denmark
Suggested that the search function search for categories too. Not only headlines
