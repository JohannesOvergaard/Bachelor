  Came to Denmark in August 2018, to study

  - ***When you think back, what was some of your first challenges when you came to Denmark?*** 

  Back in Germany, trying to find a place to live

  She could not find a list what she needed and in which order, she heard something from someone and something else from official webpages
  She would hear from her classmates that she needed i.e. residence permit
  Opening hours of government places are quite short

  Deffenrence wether you are student og working in Denmark

  - ***How did you solve it?***

  Walk into institutions and queue to get help
  Talk to other students

  Danish boyfriend 

  #### More specific (open Id√©er.md)

  - ***How did you find information regarding public institutions? Challenges and successes?***

  How does taxes works when you move in the middle of the year (also an challange in Germany)

  When you change address, how to registrer, she could not do it online

  How does it work with the Doctors was difficult to understand, when to call directly and when to call your doctor first. It is difficult to get help from friends as when you need a doctor it is quite intimate issues. Especially in the beginning when it is asking new friends.

  Getting SU was tricky, how much may you work. When talking to SU they reply in Danish even when you write in English. Then she would Google translate and then reply in English and they would reply in Danish. She was scared that something might get lost in translation.

  The holiday rules in Denmark (feriepenge), when you write to them in English they reply in Danish

  - ***How did you find information about danish culture? Challenges and successes?***

  Hard due to her choose of study, since half of the students on DIM are exchange students.

  First meeting with the danish culture, was when she met her boyfriends family, the culture are simmelar in Germany and Denmark.

  Would have liked an introduction evening about danish culture. For example more intro from ITU. They had one night where a girl came to share her experience. My impression is that she thinks ITU could have helped in several aspects of coming here.

  She mention that she is taking an danish course, where the also learns about dansih culture

  - ***What information did you need about the daily life in Denmark? How did you obtain it?***

  Copenhagen is offering a lot of events, so she don't find it difficult to fill out her sparetime.

  Difference in how you registrer work, she is used to note down every hour
  
  Where to shop what, groceries, toiletitries?
  She knows Lidl and Aldi from Germany but does not know what they classify as here, discount, upscale?
 Toiletries are difficult, Normal has a weird layout and Matas is expensive.
  In General hard to figure out where to shop what for the price you are willing to pay.
  
  Biking is the best way to come around in Denmark, introduction to the bike rules in Denmark
  
  Also introduction to rejsekortet, that you have to check in every time you change train/bus and have to check out, that rejsekortet is the cheapest way. She used the DOT app every time until she discovered that rejsekort existed.
  
  #### The app
  
  - ***If there was an app with all this information***
  
    - ***In which situation would you have used it?***
  
    Yes, if it was clear enough. There are pages from government institutions etc., but they are not clear enough. (She have some reflection around 20:00 (for reflektion over IT or reflection (omkring ansvar)). The problem is that the sites are too fluffy, she believes it might be due to liability, so the y can't say you have to do this and that as they can be liable for giving wrong or insufficient information.
  The app must differ from these sites otherwise she does not see herself using it. Needs to be clearer what to do, however, that might be difficult as people then rely on the info.
  
    We need to avertice for the applictaion. If nobody know about it won't be used. 
  
    She would still use it today when she goes from studying to working, with a-kasse and insurance.

   Need to advertise the app so people will know about it. It did not enter her mind to ever just going to app store and search for something like this.
  The app has to prove helpful then there is a better guarantee people will use it again.
  
    - ***(Short description) What does this app look like? Articles, Q&A, searchable content?*** 
  
     Tiles with different aspects, some dry topics first like taxes, how to get cpr etc.
   Other tiles with fun stuff like try these danish dishes and this danish activity in your spare time.
  First time you open it there should be a walk through of the app. When she opens it the first time, it would nice to have a couple of questions which personalises the application. I.e. do you have housing already otherwise here is some help, did you register for cpr otherwise here is what to do.
  
    - ***Maybe show our sketches afterwards and get feedback/reactions on them***
  
  ## Debriefing
  
  - ***During our project we would like to test both our intital idea and our final product on users. May we write to you again?***
  
  Yes.
  
  - **Thanks**
